This post (and this website) are built by `packer` when my AMI is generated. The whole site you're browsing right now is static flat files so there isn't much opportunity for abuse.

Unless, of course, someone were to alter my repository ðŸ¤”.

Things I'd like to do better:

- md5sum/hash checking on tasks
- a cleaner generation step because it feels really hacky the way I'm calling a shell script out of a git repository for this `jekyll` project's filesystem 
- some flair
